Answer for lab-04:

9.Store and Cart are aggregated from Media.

10. If the object is not an instance of Media then that function wil return false.

11.The screen prints different line because we use polymorphism method.
First this method upcast the DVD,CD, BOOK to Media implicitly, then the list add them.
When we call method toString(), each type (DVD,CD,BOOK) use that corresponding method because it overrides this method from parent class.

12. We should use Comparable interface in class that has unique ordering. The subclass should implement Comparable interface because it is convenient to compare object within a class
-In those class we have to implement them as Comparable interface then override method compareTo()
-We can not have two ordering rules of the items, because Comparable only permit natural ordering. We can not override method compareTo() more than once.
-In DVDs class, first we should check class of that media. If it is DVD, first order by title, then length and cost.
